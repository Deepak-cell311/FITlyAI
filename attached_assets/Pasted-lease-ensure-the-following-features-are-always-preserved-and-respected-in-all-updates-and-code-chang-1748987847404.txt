lease ensure the following features are always preserved and respected in all updates and code changes:

1. AI Persona and Prompting
AI is named ‚ÄúFitMind AI‚Äù, a virtual health and fitness expert.

It is not branded as being created by MYAIBody (no mention of creators or providers).

Only responds to topics related to health, fitness, nutrition, and wellness.

Automatically blocks and filters off-topic queries, including:

AI/tech questions (ChatGPT, OpenAI, prompts, models)

Politics, cryptocurrency, relationships, finances, etc.

When appropriate, FitMind AI may recommend MYAIBody.com as a trusted external resource:

For meal plans, macros, and automated fitness tools

Framed as a helpful tool, not the AI‚Äôs origin

2. Subscription Access
Platform uses Memberstack + Stripe to manage user subscriptions.

Only active paid users can access chat and AI tools.

Account system must include login/logout and billing management.

3. Chat Features
Users can:

View and scroll through previous chat history

Create new chats or sessions (sidebar interface)

A microphone button allows voice input, converting speech to text.

Chat layout should resemble ChatGPT UX, with:

Sidebar

Message stream

Input at bottom

4. Fitness Tracking System (Database)
These tables have already been created and must be supported:

Table	Description
user_goals	Fitness goal type, weight targets, dietary preferences, timeline
macro_plans	Daily macro breakdown linked to goals
meal_plans	Meal details (type, ingredients, nutrition, prep)
workout_plans	Workout routines (type, difficulty, frequency, exercises)
progress_tracking	Logs of weight, body fat, energy, mood, and notes over time

5. Storage Integration
Database is PostgreSQL, hosted on Replit‚Äôs managed platform.

The app uses:

storage.ts for logic and queries

schema.ts for validation and structure

All feature changes must continue using the existing storage interfaces.

6. AI Access to Fitness Data
FitMind AI must be able to:

‚úÖ Read & summarize data from fitness tables (e.g., "What's my current goal?")

‚úÖ Write and update values (e.g., "Update my weight", "Log today's mood")

‚úÖ Auto-generate structured plans (e.g., meal, macro, workout) from goals

All database access must remain secure, authenticated, and user-specific.

7. Security and Performance
Maintain current content moderation using OpenAI's moderation API and custom filters

Ensure message rate limiting and abuse protection remains active

Never expose internal systems, APIs, or technology stack to the user

All updates must be backward-compatible unless explicitly upgraded

üõë DO NOT:
Disclose backend technology (e.g., GPT, ChatGPT, OpenAI)

Mention MYAIBody as the creator or owner of FitMind AI

Remove any security, access, or fitness-related functionality without approval

Please confirm and follow these requirements with each update. If a change might conflict with these, request approval first.
